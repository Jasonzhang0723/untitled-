  <h1>My Project Statment</h1>

  <p>
    Overall, this is a project that speaks on pragmatism in
    modern Chinese society. By employing a common cultural
    symbol(s) that exists in Chinese culture and subverting
    the same ideology on the deity by asking them to “bless
    themselves.” By purchasing fifty (or more) statues of the
    same deity and placing them in physically vulnerable
    areas around the city of Chicago for X amount of
    time(days) and seeing which ones were capable of
    “blessing itself” and therefore is deemed “the real
    Buddha.” Second, after Y amount of the “true  <a class="cunt" href="https://www.taobao.com/list/item/652712576202.htm?spm=a21wu.10013406.taglist-content.17">Buddha</a>” is
    discovered, it will be sold or auctioned for Z amount of
    dollars; in reference to value, worth, and desire.
    Prior to the process of “testing” each <a href="https://www.taobao.com/list/item/652712576202.htm?spm=a21wu.10013406.taglist-content.17" target="_blank">Buddha</a>, a website
    and an Instagram page will be created to promote and
    document the process of each statue.
